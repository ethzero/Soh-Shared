Colony Kits
===========

This document give guidance to the quantity of materials required for intra- and extra-system colonisation.



Intra-System
------------

Intra-system (IS) colonisation is the colonisation of additional Planets beyond the already established "home" planet or first colonised planet of a system. 


"IS" colonisation requires the least amount of supplies & material as the kit's prime function is to give the planet's ability to import further materials.

This kit will provide for:
	* Town square
	* Airport & Broker to transfer Goods
