OA I - Section 2
Mine Gems(TL 30)
	
[]
OA VII - Section 2 -
Mine ICE
	Convert Ice to Air(better than straight air by a few tech levels)
		Convert hydrogen and air into water(will produce TL30 water instead of TL29 water)
			Convert Water into Air(will produce TL 30 air for TL30 ships)(create system by airport, so that the TL30 is immediately absorbed into the ship
																			Dont turn system on unless ready to build)

RINGS
Mine Eludium(shitty TL otherwise)
Both rings produce TL27
	Mine from Nova Respite to Nova Respite(time saved, better of the qaulities)
	
MANUFACTURING
	
IX - Section 1 - Also, other minerals on planet good for limited production(until higher TL levels require better materials)
Use for Material Production(Full Production, no base components)
